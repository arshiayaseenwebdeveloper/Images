        Animal instincts drive behaviors like migration, hunting, and mating.
        Social animals, like ants and wolves, live in highly organized groups.
        Solitary animals, such as tigers and leopards, prefer to live alone.
        Animal senses, such as sight, hearing, smell, and echolocation, help animals navigate and hunt.
        Mimicry in animals, like the stick insect’s camouflage, helps them avoid predators.
        Animal migrations, such as the journey of monarch butterflies, are triggered by seasonal changes.
